## Shortest Path Algorithms
### Floyd's Algorithm
1. Efficiency is O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) for simplist implementation.
2. Efficiency is O(|V|<sup>3</sup>) starting at all possible start nodes, find shortest path to all possible pairs.

### Dikjstra's Algorithm
* Tells you the shortest path from one node to all other node in the graph.
* Positive weights only, does not work for negative weighted graphs.
* Greedy algorithm.

* Efficiency is `O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)` simplist implementation.  
* Efficiency is `O(|E|+|V|log|V|)` to reach all possible nodes in the graph.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* At most runs |V|-1 times to find shortest path
* Compute all outgoing edges
* Works on graphs negative edge wieghts
* Not a greedy algorithm

**Efficiency is O{|E|.|V|)**

### Prim's Algorithm
* Minimum spanning tree
* Greedy algorithm
* Add the edge

**Efficiency** for Adjacency Matrix is `O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)`  
**Efficiency** for Binary Heap and Adjacency List is `O(|V|log|V|+|E|log|V|)`
