# P vs NP

* **P** is a polynomial time.  
* **NP** non-deterministic polynomial time.  
* Problems may or may not be easy to solve, but are easy to check if solution is correct.  
* If a problem is in **P** then it is also in **NP**
* **NPC** is NP Complete problems.
* **NPH** is NP Hard, EXPTIME
* Is hard to solve, but also hard to verify a solution
* Easy to understand but hard to solve maths problem.
